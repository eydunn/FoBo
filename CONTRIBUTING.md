We love contributions and the best way to do it is via pull requests. 

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repository switch to the develop branch and optionally make a feature branch on it (good practice).

2. Verify that your contribution is working as expected, preferably, but not mandatory, with a written test.

3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not accept, pull requests within a week.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted

* Update the documentation, including the API documentation and whatever is affected by your contribution.
* Comment your pull request with clear explanation of what your contribution will accomplish.

Syntax:
FoBo uses the scalafmt scala code formater plugin to format the code so you do not have to worry about it 
but here is some guidelines:  

* No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.
* Try follow the conventions you see used in the source already.

Thanks a million! We are looking forward to see your contribution!
